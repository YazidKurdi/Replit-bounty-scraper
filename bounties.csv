Acceptance will be a simple, undesigned web application does the following:

User uploads arbitrary file (that can be a large text dataset like a bunch of blogposts for example)

Component Requirement
Components should have typed props.
Components can be styled with tailwind, or modularized css/scss.
They can use any external library that doesn't depend on global scripts/stylesheet injection.
You can assume every react app using these components will be using Tailwind.

My test for this would be if I could implement the OpenAI playground exactly like it is using basic flexbox and these components.

I basically want exactly this Mac app: https://github.com/sirkevinwang/Blink on mobile.

You can also opt to write an iOS application instead of Android. However, I think iOS will be much harder since iOS disallows background video, you'll have to work around it by either 1) publishing on a sideloading app store, so not officially downloadable or 2) using a zoom-like technique where the video is in a small screen in the corner on top of the current application. Thus, I think Android will be easier; however, if your expertise is Swift or you want to adapt the linked repo, I am also open to this.

331,$135.00,due in 28 days,Food Cart Ingredient Checker,"A chrome extension where I put in ingredients that I don't like. Then, it goes through my current Instacart/Amazon Fresh page (it could be a list of products or it could be my cart or it could be a store name, and it goes through all of the products in advance), and finds each of those foods on ingredient websites and scrapes the ingredients, and flags foods with user-specified bad ingredient, for instance, ""cashew"".

This may require translation from another language. For instance, with this product: https://www.instacart.com/store/hmart/products/2597283 instacart does not show any ingredients, and you'll have to find it in an external website and translate it, then search it.

369,"$1,665.00",due in 1 month,A customized version of ChatGPT for the Communications/PR Industry,"#The last time the PR industry was disrupted was the launch of Microsoft Word. It's a very analog sector, and most of the work products are basic -- but still customized -- pieces of writing: press releases, op-eds, media advisories. ChatGPT can produce drafts of these, but they still aren't specific enough to be useful for an individual or a company. By developing a customized version of ChatGPT -- one which effectively guides the user through inputting the right documents and content -- I hope to build a program automates much of the basic writing in the communications sector.

#A simple interface where non-technical users can input relevant documents (.doc and google doc files) and guidance that will allow the customized version of GPT-3 to output more personalized and relevant writing
#Ideally, I would also like to explore how a voice-to-text function could be plugged in. For instance, could a file from a service like Otter.ai or Rev.com be used as an input",RyanJacobs9,19 hours ago,https://replit.com/bounties/@RyanJacobs9/a-customized-version?t=
