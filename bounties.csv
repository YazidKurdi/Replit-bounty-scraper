Acceptance will be a simple, undesigned web application does the following:

User uploads arbitrary file (that can be a large text dataset like a bunch of blogposts for example)

Component Requirement
Components should have typed props.
Components can be styled with tailwind, or modularized css/scss.
They can use any external library that doesn't depend on global scripts/stylesheet injection.
You can assume every react app using these components will be using Tailwind.

My test for this would be if I could implement the OpenAI playground exactly like it is using basic flexbox and these components.

I basically want exactly this Mac app: https://github.com/sirkevinwang/Blink on mobile.

You can also opt to write an iOS application instead of Android. However, I think iOS will be much harder since iOS disallows background video, you'll have to work around it by either 1) publishing on a sideloading app store, so not officially downloadable or 2) using a zoom-like technique where the video is in a small screen in the corner on top of the current application. Thus, I think Android will be easier; however, if your expertise is Swift or you want to adapt the linked repo, I am also open to this.

331,$135.00,due in 28 days,Food Cart Ingredient Checker,"A chrome extension where I put in ingredients that I don't like. Then, it goes through my current Instacart/Amazon Fresh page (it could be a list of products or it could be my cart or it could be a store name, and it goes through all of the products in advance), and finds each of those foods on ingredient websites and scrapes the ingredients, and flags foods with user-specified bad ingredient, for instance, ""cashew"".

This may require translation from another language. For instance, with this product: https://www.instacart.com/store/hmart/products/2597283 instacart does not show any ingredients, and you'll have to find it in an external website and translate it, then search it.

By developing a customized version of ChatGPT -- one which effectively guides the user through inputting the right documents and content -- I hope to build a program automates much of the basic writing in the communications sector.

#A simple interface where non-technical users can input relevant documents (.doc and google doc files) and guidance that will allow the customized version of GPT-3 to output more personalized and relevant writing

We can solve this by optionally (enabled using configuration properties in application.yaml) prepending the caller class and line number in a comment on each generated query.

For example, instead of select t0.uuid, t0.createdat... we would generate /* MyClass:123 */ select t0.uuid, t0.createdat...

Delivery is a PR against the ebean project (https://github.com/ebean-orm). If not accepted by ebean's maintainers, we'll fork it.

Acceptance Criteria
Correctly prepends caller class name and line number to every query when enabled by configuration
Has no effect if not enabled by configuration
Works in both Kotlin and Java projects
Unit tests cover the core comment behavior and have 100% coverage of newly added lines

I have a work-in-progress solution which does not yet work for all cases. I would like help to complete it so I can focus on other parts of my app.

Problem Description
I want to enumerate the possible auto-complete import options for a package given the package's TypeScript definitions (e.g. d.ts files from DefinitelyTyped).

Example: Lodash package
See https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15

For example:

Should list those shown in the documentation: https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#orderBy
chunk
compact
...
orderBy

import { chunk, compact, orderBy } from ""lodash""; // VALID

However, it should NOT list those which are from instances:
toJSON, valueOf, value, etc are shown in the docs ( https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#prototype-value ), however, they are attached to an instance not directly from the import.

Problem Description
Need a JS SDK built for the frontend that exposes a global function called getAccessToken().

When called, it should return a promise that does the following:

Checks if user is logged in.

If not, give options to login with ""Google"" and ""Github"" in a top-right popup.

Checks if user has available credit.

If not, lead user to purchase credits.

-> Topup in same popup.
-> Add payment method in new tab.

Is quota up for current domain?

Use slider in same popup to select quota.

If all checks pass, calls the backend using the authentication headers/tokens of Google/Github.

The backend should check if the user has enough credit and quota for the domain.

If all checks pass, the backend should return a randomly generated access token (The access token can be anything random, not going to be used at this stage).

Then, it should generate a video from those prompts. It should be low sampling steps and 200 frames so that it is fast. Specifically, you should reduce the framecount from 1000 to 200, the sampling steps from 50 to 2, and the prompt from text to image (with weight near 0.6) for speed.

You can see how it runs in a UI easily here: https://github.com/deforum-art/deforum-for-automatic1111-webui and you only need to deploy it to an endpoint where I pass in an image, framecount, strength, and sampling steps, and get a video.
