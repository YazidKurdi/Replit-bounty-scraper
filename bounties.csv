113,$180.00,due in 13 days,Mastadon Daily Active User Dashboard,"Mastadon is a distributed Twitter alternative that spiked in popularity. The problem is to estimate the size of the communities on an ongoing active basis. There are thousands of servers which users can join. I believe users can be part of multiple servers. The goal is to create a basic metrics dashboard which updates daily with the number of servers being processed and the number of active users on each platform. Don't abuse servers with overly frequent or aggressive polling.

Acceptance Criteria
Website reflects the total daily active users on Mastadon
As more days pass, a graph of DAU updates
Reflect the last time the calculation was run
The site is open source, linking to the code that runs the site
Ideally, the DAU for each server could be listed as well, in decreasing rank order of the top N

114,$58.50,due in 21 days,Make a port of my Fitbit game to Apple watches,"I've recently made and published a game on the Fitbit appstore, called ""Fit Hunt"". It's garnered a small community of hunters, but I think the reach can be extended being ported to Apple's line of watches as Fitbit is slowly dying.

I realise the amount this bounty is asking for may not seem like much, however the game's core mechanics shouldn't take more than a day and you'll have reins over the Apple section of the community.

Acceptance Criteria
I want a close-enough port of the game on Apple watches, using the same server as the Fitbit one does, with all the core functionality. I'll provide all the details to the game.

Hunters must:
Have some experience with creating apps for Apple watches
Be able to produce a version ready for publishing on the App store
Provide the app in a few select languages, with the help of Google translate of course.",codingMASTER398,8 hours ago,https://replit.com/bounties/@codingMASTER398/make-a-port-of-my-fi?t=

I need there to be a GUI where it can accept a link of the podcast (can be a youtube link, a spotify link, other links for the podcast so it can be downloaded) and then have it downloaded from the link and transcribed into a .txt file with the name of the episode transcribed + ""transcription"" as the file name.

I also would like the script to be done on python and in a way that I can transcribe episodes on my local computer with my 3070 GPU.

Acceptance Criteria
I need someone with a background building an easy/robust GUI on python that can easily finish this part of the script so that I can bulk transcribe episodes of podcasts just by pasting the link in the GUI.

120,$360.00,due in 19 days,Dictation app that can transcribe text and create properly formatted reports,"I want to create a custom dictation app that can transcribe my spoken text into a properly formatted report.

I create formatted technical reports for clients in my current job, about 30-40 times a day.  I use a dictation tool that allows me to freely dictate my findings, but I have to mentally organize my thoughts for a few moments so that I can say everything in the proper sequence. Alternatively,  I can dictate the findings out of order and then spend time manually rearranging and formatting the report. I also have the ability to create basic macros with this tool, where I can say one word or phrase and it will output a pre-completed body of text. However, this macro feature is not very flexible and cannot adjust the output based on the context of the report. Lastly, the current system has no idea if it mistranscribed a word because it doesn't understand the context.

The app should be able to listen when I click dictate and continue listening even when I switch ...",mokal,6 hours ago,https://replit.com/bounties/@mokal/dictation-app-that-c?t=

Problem:
Basically, I am looking to upload a photo, then through the magic of ai, generate a new version of the person in that photo in a different scenario. Example, I upload my picture and then tell the AI to redraw me in Paris, or redraw me as a painting by Van Gogh, or cartoon me like a simpson's cartoon.

After I upload the image, I select the criteria for my image, and AI outputs the finished product.

The user is then able to order that product in any number of formats. As a canvas, on a coffee mug, etc. I will provide the products that will be offered.

Users will need to sign up or sign in through another platform to use the site.
