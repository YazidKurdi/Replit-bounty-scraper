1,$10.00,due in 8 days,‚åöÔ∏è Apple Watch Compass App (Orientation Based Vibration) [Swift],"Trying to see the possibility of an Apple Watch app that notifies (vibration) the user when they are facing North. That's all. No need for other features. No connection to phone/internet.

It would (I believe) primarily use this feature: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmagnetometerdata/1616084-magneticfield

And would use the Apple Watch 5 and Later for magnometer (compass) feature.

MVP: If user's wrist is facing 'north', slightly vibrate for 1s.

Acceptance Criteria
MVP or potential for MVP.
A TestFlight ready app that vibrates for 1s when the user faces North each time.
e.g. I walk and turn east, no vibration
I keep waking and turn north, slight 1s vibration.
I turn west, no vibration.
I turn north again, 1s vibration.",Bandos1000,18 hours ago,https://replit.com/bounties/@Bandos1000/apple-watch-compass?t=

4,$135.00,closed,GPT3 AI Story Video Generator,"I would like to create a tool that can create Story Videos based on prompts. It can be a simple command line tool, no need for a website or app.

User inputs story prompt (ex. A story about a girl and a big mountain)
Story is given to GPT-3 API, in a way so that it gives the story text and descriptions of images for the story (to be used by DALLE-2)
Image prompts from GPT-3 output will be fed to DALLE-2 API (or a different image generating AI)
Story is read by Text-To-Speech API (for ex. Azure Cognitive Services)
Audio and Images are combined to create a single video using the https://remotion.dev library.

Basically, the tool should be written in JavaScript, retrieve data from all the required APIs, and use the Remotion library to create a video from these outputs.
