1,$10.00,due in 9 days,‚åöÔ∏è Apple Watch Compass App (Orientation Based Vibration) [Swift],"Trying to see the possibility of an Apple Watch app that notifies (vibration) the user when they are facing North. That's all. No need for other features. No connection to phone/internet.

It would (I believe) primarily use this feature: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmmagnetometerdata/1616084-magneticfield

And would use the Apple Watch 5 and Later for magnometer (compass) feature.

MVP: If user's wrist is facing 'north', slightly vibrate for 1s.

Acceptance Criteria
MVP or potential for MVP.
A TestFlight ready app that vibrates for 1s when the user faces North each time.
e.g. I walk and turn east, no vibration
I keep waking and turn north, slight 1s vibration.
I turn west, no vibration.
I turn north again, 1s vibration.",Bandos1000,14 hours ago,https://replit.com/bounties/@Bandos1000/apple-watch-compass?t=
2,$90.00,due in 3 days,Create a modal in react using the UX mockup provided.,"Create a modal in react js using the UX mockup provided
Image Grid - A vertically scrollable list of images. The backend api will be provided to you. On hover each image should show an enlarge/preview icon, which should show just the image in another full screen modal

New Images Button - When this button is clicked, an api request must be made, the 'New Images Grid' should show a loader while the api request is being processed. When the api request is complete, the  grid should show the returned images as a 2*2 grid. The backend api will be provided.

This is primarily a design job , so in addition to the UX, a good looking UI also needs to be implemented.

3,$5.00,due in 12 days,üìä Basic Front End + DataPull for RuneScape competition,"Trying to create an epic website to see the status of the Speedrun competition in OSRS.
I've made a quick frame of it here: https://www.figma.com/file/3anndl61BWgpo0Kpzewhpr/OSRS-Proj?node-id=1%3A2&t=VYyI0mIMSQzxnqh4-1

Ideally, would work on Mobile and Web. Not sure what the best way to build this is.
I'll need to manually enter the:
Speedrunner names
Speedrunner Youtube/Twitch channels

The most challenging aspect is pulling a iframe from https://wiseoldman.net with a selected username: https://wiseoldman.net/players/phonk%20addict
And only displaying the stats section (as seen in Figma)

I think there are 2-6 right now. I would like the ability to add more speed runners in the future.
Acceptance Criteria
A stunning website to see who is currently winning/speedrunning OSRS. I will connect a custom domain after delivery.
I have no problem with crediting you/linking your Replit profile on the site.",Bandos1000,13 hours ago,https://replit.com/bounties/@Bandos1000/basic-front-end-data?t=
4,$135.00,closed,GPT3 AI Story Video Generator,"I would like to create a tool that can create Story Videos based on prompts. It can be a simple command line tool, no need for a website or app.

User inputs story prompt (ex. A story about a girl and a big mountain)
Story is given to GPT-3 API, in a way so that it gives the story text and descriptions of images for the story (to be used by DALLE-2)
Image prompts from GPT-3 output will be fed to DALLE-2 API (or a different image generating AI)
Story is read by Text-To-Speech API (for ex. Azure Cognitive Services)
Audio and Images are combined to create a single video using the https://remotion.dev library.

Basically, the tool should be written in JavaScript, retrieve data from all the required APIs, and use the Remotion library to create a video from these outputs.

I am a coder myself who has used all these API's and libraries before, and I can provide support if you need any help.",CoderGautamYT,12 hours ago,https://replit.com/bounties/@CoderGautamYT/gpt3-ai-story-video?t=
