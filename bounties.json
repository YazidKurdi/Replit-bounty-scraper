I use a dictation tool that allows me to freely dictate my findings, but I have to mentally organize my thoughts for a few moments so that I can say everything in the proper sequence. Alternatively,  I can dictate the findings out of order and then spend time manually rearranging and formatting the report. I also have the ability to create basic macros with this tool, where I can say one word or phrase and it will output a pre-completed body of text. However, this macro feature is not very flexible and cannot adjust the output based on the context of the report. Lastly, the current system has no idea if it mistranscribed a word because it doesn't understand the context.\n\nThe app should be able to listen when I click dictate and continue listening even when I switch ...",

I can not mix video without affecting audio on scratch mode. *\n\nSolution\n\nUsing 2 video streams and muting one track, mix the other while in sync, one video is muted, and the audio stays unaffected.\n\nI have got this to work without code. I can set this up manually. It should only take a pro about an hour, but if someone wants to learn and take longer, still apply.\n\nI have a patent description for this \u2014 also an example video.\n\nThere is an SDK kit on the website, and they recommend C++\n(Maybe with Ghostwriter, you can convert the code if C++ is not your thing)\n\n[Virtual DJ site] (https://www.virtualdj.com/wiki/Developers)\n\n*You do not need a controller; this costs nothing; VDJ is free and open-sourced.\n\nI am also happy to learn; teach me how you did it.\n\nIn return, I could teach you some DJing.",

You can find more information on their APIs at the following link: https://tiendanube.github.io/api-documentation/intro\n\nProposed Solution\n\nCreate a private app for TiendaNube that enables user/store registration and installs three webhooks for the store: order creation, order update, and order paid. The app will listen to these webhooks and send a reminder to the potential buyer via WhatsApp using Twilio if an order is created but not paid within 24 hours.\n\nNote that the Twilio integration will not be your responsibility and your job will end by notifying our endpoint of an abandoned order (24 hours after creation without payment).\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nThe app is functional and allows for multi-user/multi-store registration.

For prompt engineering you'll receive my help.\nTechnical Details\nText from image/PDF extractions can be done preferably in Python but in any other language that works. OpenAI API can also be called using any language of preference. The frontend has to be minimal for an MVP.\nTimelines / Milestones\nExpected deadline after 7 days of acceptance.

        "description": "Our Chrome Extension currently works by loading a search bar when a shortcut 'Command+K' is hit. However, if a web app e.g. Gmail, previously had a function with that same shortcut, our extension overrules this. This is undesirable as it ruins the functionality of many web apps such as Notion, Superhuman and Gmail.\n\nWe would like for the code to be edited such that the web app is given precendence whenever there is a shortcut conflict.\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nDeliverable in a few hours\n\nEdits the provided code such that the functionality of the chrome extension remains unchanged except for the fact that the chrome extension's shortcut now does not function on web apps where there is a shortcut conflict and instead, the web app shortcut functions as expected.\n\nCompiles the code and provides the final set of compiled code that's ready to be used as a chrome extension.\n\nTechnical Details\nReact/JS/Docker",

My criteria is:\nUses Python (Nextcord or Discord.py)\nUses slash commands\nIMPORTANT: Uses HTTP interactions, not gateway - You may need to set up a WEB SERVER or use a HTTP interaction library to create this.\nEntries to the giveaway should use buttons, should function similarly to GiveawayBot\nCommands: /start, /end, /reroll\nGiveaways should still end as usual if the bot restarts. A MongoDB database would be preferred, however if this is not feasible then use JSON\n\nI can always raise the cycle amount if this is not enough, please just let me know in your application!",
