I use a dictation tool that allows me to freely dictate my findings, but I have to mentally organize my thoughts for a few moments so that I can say everything in the proper sequence. Alternatively,  I can dictate the findings out of order and then spend time manually rearranging and formatting the report. I also have the ability to create basic macros with this tool, where I can say one word or phrase and it will output a pre-completed body of text. However, this macro feature is not very flexible and cannot adjust the output based on the context of the report. Lastly, the current system has no idea if it mistranscribed a word because it doesn't understand the context.\n\nThe app should be able to listen when I click dictate and continue listening even when I switch ...",

The buttons will be visible to the customer, but the prompt will not. If the original prompt is \"make it pop\", and one of the buttons is pressed, the prompt we use then would be \"make it pop\" + anything we stored behind the button...",
